-What kinds of messages will be exchanged across the control connection?

The control connection will be used to exchange commands sent by the client. The commands the client will send are: put, get, ls, lls, and quit.
lls is executed entirely in client without the need to be exchanged with the server. 


-How does the other side respond to each type of message?

If the server receives "put", it will download the file that was sent by the client. 

If the server receives "get", it will send the requested file to the client to download.

If the server receives "ls", it will return to the client a list of all the files the server contains.

If the server receives "quit", it will close the shared connection with the client. 

Each command listed here other than quit will create an ephemeral port to connect the server and the client and allow data transfer between them. 
After data transfer is complete, the ephemeral port is closed.

-What sizes/formats will the messages have?

'ls'

'lls'

'quit'

'get <file-name>'

'put <file-name>'


-What message exchanges have to take place in order to setup a file transfer channel?

The initial command such as "get"
then a connection with a new "data socket"
then finally the file can transfer

-How will the receiving side know when to start/stop receiving the file?

Every data packet that is send begins with a 10 byte "size" variable that will tell the receiver how long to listen for a message
